Creating a high-quality developer experience, is one of the most difficult aspects of developer marketing and developer relations. As an industry, we’ve been really dependent on the use of in-person events to create unique experiences for our developer communities. Creating good experiences in-person is difficult, but now that conferences and Meetups have been moved online, that challenge has increased exponentially. 

Whether we realize it or not, developers have been conditioned by software vendors to expect very specific experience in return for joining their community, using their product, or participating in an event. They expect to speak with a subject matter expert vs a sales rep, they expect to receive swag for visiting the booth, they expect to be invited to the developer-only happy hour, they expect to receive a level of insight into the product roadmap, they expect the vendor to have well documented online resources that they can easily access, and so much more. Many of these activities are impossible to pull-off virtually. So how do you make up for it?

I’m confident that in the future, someone will create a platform that works really well for driving engagement online. Until that happens, there are a few obvious areas which I believe are ‘quick-wins’ for creating a better developer experience online. 

<h3>Refocusing on digital evangelism</h3>

Digital evangelism is not a new concept to developer marketing, however, in most developer organizations digital evangelism has been more of an afterthought. Similar to the normal role of developer evangelists/advocates/relations, digital evangelism takes the 1:1/1:few interactions that would normally take place at a conference or on-site with a customer and prioritizes them online. These interactions usually take place on forum style channels, like Reddit, Hacker news, or Quora, but they are not limited to those channels. Pulling it off requires teams to dedicate resources to spending time on these channels so that the community can come to trust and expect those individuals. Digital evangelism is the most impactful and easiest way to improve your virtual developer experience.

<h3>Embracing the live stream</h3>

Live-streaming is a major part of the digital evangelism role that we covered above. Similar to how a gamer would create a streaming schedule on Twitch, having your DevRel team spend unstructured time interacting and responding with live chat feeds is a great way to engage your community outside an in-person event. We’ve seen this type of interaction happen during virtual conferences, but I think that moving forward it is going to play a larger role with developer marketing strategies. 

<h3>Leveling-up product documentation</h3>

Good documentation is a force multiplier for small DevRel and developer marketing teams. There is a ton of developer data that showcases the importance of good product documentation and the frustration that poor documentation creates for developers. As we focus more on virtual experiences, it’s important to make sure that your documentation doesn’t undermine that effort. The better your documentation is, the less time your digital evangelists will need to spend on topics that are ‘well-documented’.

<h3>Shifting to a programmatic focus</h3>

Developer marketing is built on programmatic elements. A programmatic element is a marketing effort that doesn’t have a defined start and end date (unlike a campaign). This would include a weekly/monthly developer newsletter, cadenced tech talks, podcasts, or consistent publishing on a blog/social. These elements are designed to build awareness and affinity. The more virtual your developer marketing strategy becomes, the more important it is to embrace and develop programmatic elements.

<h3>Developing your online tone</h3>

Building trust, relationships, and affinity online is hard. Using a flat or overly-corporate tone in your copy makes it difficult for your audience to relate to your organization. Taking a more casual tone online can be intimidating, but I encourage marketing teams to try. Casual tones encourage engagement from the community, make interactions seem a lot less intimidating, and are a lot more enjoyable from an audience perspective.

<h3>Eliminating vendor bias</h3>

One of the biggest issues in developer marketing is vendor or solution bias. The goal of developer marketing isn’t to sell, instead your goal is to help developer solve their problems. Since there is no such thing as a one-size fits all solution, constantly pushing your product is a big turn-off for developers. Your goal should be to provide the best solution, sometimes it’s your product, sometimes it’s an upstream project, and other times it’s another vendor's product. At the end of the day, adding unbiased value will have a greater ROI than pushing a sub-par solution.
