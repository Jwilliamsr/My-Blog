title: "developer communities. a deep-dive"
---
One of the main reasons I've been inspired to publish again is the lack of quality developer-focused marketing content. Developer marketing is my bread and butter and when, or maybe I should say if you figure it out, it's an incredibly enjoyable audience to interact with. That being said, it's an uphill battle. Developer audiences require you to have a deep understanding of the technologies that matter to them, emerging trends, communication styles, niche interests, and of course the communities where they spend their time. In this post, I want to introduce you to the less-known online developer communities. 

Please note, I'm not sharing this information so that you can SPAM developers audiences more efficiently. When it comes to developer communities, your impact is predicated on the value you can provide.

A quick Google will reveal the obvious candidates for this post, Reddit, Hacker News, Stack Overflow, and GitHub. Those communities are great, and if you can figure out a strategy to drive value and interactions on them, you are on your way. In this post, we are going to talk about a few that you probably don't know of. 

<h3>1. Lobste.rs</h3> 
<a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a> is a Hacker News style forum with a few key differences that make it a unique place. First, Lobsters is an invitation-only community. You have to know someone to get an invite or ask for one on their IRC. Second, Lobsters has a 'hat' feature that lets members verify their profiles to earn a hat. Hats indicate a level of authority on a topic which allows a member to speak on behalf of a project, organization, or company.

<h3>2. Slash.Dot</h3>  
<a href="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> is a forum-based community that is relatively unknown. Unlike the rest of these communities, Slashdot was founded during the Dotcom era and is still going strong. It's a highly technical community with strong mods. This community is unique because of the ability to filter comments by type: Insightful, Informative, Interesting, and Funny. This limits thread clutter and allows users to engage with content in their preferred way. 

<h3>3. Hashnode</h3>  
<a href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> is an up-and-coming developer community picking up a ton of steam. It was birthed out of the desire for developers to have a place to start a conversation and get quality and most importantly friendly responses. Hashnode is more than just a forum, it features QAs, AMAs, submitted stories and a blogging platform. Unique to Hashnoed, they feature an open ranking system based on how helpful a user is. 

<h3>4. Dev.to</h3> 
<a href="https://dev.to">Dev.to</a> is another up-and-coming community. Dev.to focuses on providing a place for developers to advance their careers by asking questions. Dev.to is based around a #tagging system that allows you to personalize your experience. It's almost like Sub-Reddits, but not quite as separate. Dev.to was clearly designed to appeal to the next generation of developers with an almost GitHuby feel. 

<h3>5. CodeProject</h3> 
<a href="https://codeproject.com">CodeProject</a> is another online forum for developers. It's one of the larger communities, boasting over 14 million members. CodeProject focuses on long-form technical content and is not specific to a language, framework, or role. CodeProject feels like a combination of Reddit and Stack Overflow but without some of the more hostile tendencies. 

<h3>6. 4chan</h3> 
It would be remiss to not mention <a href="https://4chan.com">4chan</a>, however, it should be noted that 4chan is easily one of the most questionable places on the internet. 4chan is in many ways is the closest thing to the dark web that most people will ever experience. 4chan hosts a huge developer community, but the focus of the site itself is not necessarily technical content.
