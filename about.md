## about me
Welcome, My name is Jesse Williams.

This is where I house my thoughts on topics that interest me including: Startups, Marketing, Technology, Finance & anything else that catches my attention. The opinions that you will find in my posts are my own, they are taken directly from my current views on life, which I expect will change as I grow and experience more. Life is a journey, you can follow mine or ignore it ... trolling is unappreciated.

All is grace,</br>
Jesse
